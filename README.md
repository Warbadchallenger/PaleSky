# PaleSky
First Game
Ok along with the Omega Platform I am working on my first game Pale Sky. Pale Sky is an rpg using The Leadwerks Engine and i deally the
concept includes updating the game rather than making a sequel. As an online game with hat i am able to do now to lighten it up you will 
be able to secure your castle from monsters and as an MMO you will run almost all of you kingdom by the UI unlocking facets of your castle 
the more you delve into its depths beginning by starting your anerobic digester to allow underground settlement. A focus on tactics and a 
robust stat mechanism will lead the way for the future of Pale Skies developement into a living world where the US dollar reigns supreme 
from the get go and your patrols and outposts will stave off the invading parties as much as they can untill you are left only with your 
fortress and only a pale sky to warm your heart as you take your arms.
If you are interested in participating in this project I am a former US marine infantry man and got a little bit of knowledge of vast 
amounts of tactics to begin with its just your time that can be put into this from your own kindness as the project grows you could actually 
get paid. The entity immiedietly running the project is Polearm Games which is a division of my S-Corporation an actual corporation Visions 
Corp EIN 82-3671987. You are more than welcome to join and ill figure out what hiring entails and what you are entitled to as well and if 
you are interested you can email me, I am the CEO (shane Ferkovich) at sf3.16790349206360775@yahoo.com, have a good one and look forward
